Writer Drew Holmes expressed the difficulty in determining what was too risqué for the game. In keeping with series advertising, Saints Row: The Third included sex symbol Sasha Grey in the production as a character voice. Other celebrity voice actors include Hulk Hogan and Daniel Dae Kim.The development team also pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas for others to advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in a world editor by Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG), which was continually built in the four years preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third uses Havok's physics middleware with customizations. which let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction.

The local, he says, described Cuprom's mining equipment under Ceaușescu to be \"rudimentary\", incapable of fully extracting the most fine-grained gold or copper from its ore. Since Cuprom was built on a swamp, this local said, the only way to maintain structural integrity while building out the complex over the years had been to use this under-extracted backfill to fill in the marshland. This, Boldor claims, is why the dirt around the Cuprom complex contains millions of dollars of unprocessed gold and copper.\nIn 2012, Baia Mare's mayor declared hundreds of Roma shanties just outside the city unfit for habitation and forced the families to relocate into an abandoned block of offices in the Cuprom complex. For decades, Roma had made a living selling scrap metal from the same facilities. Boldor believed the only way to pull these Roma out of poverty was to show them what a successful Roma looked like.

Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairman John R. Beckett concerning the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when Fortune magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.

Above all they should have guarded against all sedition.\nErasmus had been involved in early attempts to protect Luther and his sympathisers from charges of heresy. Erasmus wrote Inquisitio de fide to limit what should be considered heresy to fractiously agitating against essential doctrines (e.g., those of the Creed), with malice and persistence.

In the Olympic final, Boston exchanged the lead with Ter-Ovanesyan. Going into the fifth round, Boston was leading but fouled while both Lynn Davies and Ter-Ovanesyan jumped past him. On his final jump, he was able to jump past Ter-Ovanesyan, but could not catch Davies and ended winning the silver medal.Boston's final record improvement to 8.35 m was again at the 1965 Modesto Relays.  It was tied at altitude by Ter-Ovanesyan in 1967. In 1967, he lost the national title to Jerry Proctor.

Cameron reportedly told Bay about 3-D, \"You gotta look at it as a toy, it's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience.\" Bay was reluctant to film with 3-D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style, but he did not want to implement the technology in post production either since he was not pleased with the results. In addition to using the 3-D Fusion camera rigs developed by Cameron's team, Bay and the team spent nine months developing a more portable 3-D camera that could be brought into location. On the day of the film's release, Shia LaBeouf announced that Dark of the Moon will be his last Transformers film.\nIn a hidden extra for the Blu-ray release of Revenge of the Fallen, Bay expressed his intention to make Transformers 3 not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen, but instead deeper into the mythology, to give it more character development, and to make it darker and more emotional."

In Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. The son mentioned here is traditionally understood to be Ishmael. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing him. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision.

In the footage, a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard released dimensions of the aircraft, including a wingspan of about 26 metres (85 ft), a height of 1.84 metres (6.0 ft), and a length of 4.5 metres (15 ft).\n\n Operational history \nThe 30th Reconnaissance Squadron was the first unit to operate RQ-170 Sentinels. Based at Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada, this squadron was activated on 1 September 2005.

That year, MGM sold the two properties for $3.89 billion in cash to The Blackstone Group, which leased them back to MGM for an annual rent of $215 million.\n\n Design and technology \nAria was designed by Pelli Clark Pelli Architects, which spent two months with MGM discussing the project's design. Aria was the firm's first casino design. Unlike other Las Vegas resorts, Aria does not feature a theme. According to César Pelli, \"When you don't have a theme, the attraction of the building has to rest in the beauty of the architecture\". The design incorporates natural materials such as foliage, glass, wood, and stone. Real and fake trees are located in numerous resort facilities, including some of the restaurants. Interior designer Peter Marino worked on several areas of the resort, including hotel suites and a high-limit gaming area.Technology was incorporated in the resort's exterior and interior design, specifically for the reduction of energy consumption. For its environmentally friendly design, Aria received LEED Gold certification, becoming the largest hotel in the world to achieve such a feat. Aria"

The lack of coppering the navy was one of the key reasons leading to Britain losing the Thirteen Colonies.In 1778 the new Navy Board Controller Charles Middleton, who had the major problem at the time with supplying over 100 ships for the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), compounded that year by French opportunism in declaring war on Britain to support the American rebels, effectively turned what was a local civil war into a global conflict. Others followed: Spain in 1779 and the Netherlands in 1780. Middleton took the view that Britain was \"outnumbered at every station\", and the navy was required to \"extricate us from present danger\". He understood that coppering allowed the navy to stay at sea for much longer without the need for cleaning and repairs to the underwater hull, making it a very attractive, if expensive, proposition.

Nothing unusual in that. But the song is sung in the voice of a rough American hobo type utterly unaccustomed to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And there comes a moment, when the singer declares his heart is breaking, that’s almost unbearably moving because of the tension between the sentiment itself and the huge resistance that’s obviously been overcome to utter it. Waits sings the line with cathartic magnificence, and you feel a lifetime of tough-guy stoicism crumbling in the face of overwhelming sadness. I heard this and reversed a decision I’d made, that Stevens would remain emotionally buttoned up right to the bitter end.  I decided that at just one point – which I’d have to choose very carefully – his rigid defence would crack, and a hitherto concealed tragic romanticism would be glimpsed.\nAnother author who notes Waits's influence is Ian Rankin:I already knew Tom Waits’s music, those soulful communications from the louche underbelly of the American dream, but nothing had prepared me for Swordfishtrom"

In Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. The son mentioned here is traditionally understood to be Ishmael. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing him. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised"

In the end, Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, NE-02, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Donald Trump won ME-02, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.\nCampaign strategies are not universal in swing states. Statistical analytics website FiveThirtyEight notes that some swing states, such as New Hampshire, swing because they have many moderate, independent swing voters, and campaigning puts an emphasis on persuading voters. Contrasting this is Georgia, which is a swing state because it has large populations of Republican-leaning evangelical whites and Democratic-leaning Black voters and urban college-educated professionals, thus campaigns often concentrate on voter turnout.\n\n Determining swing states \nPresidential campaigns and pundits seek to keep track of the shifting electoral landscape. While swing states in past elections can be determined simply by looking at how close the vote was in each state, determining states likely to be swing states in future elections requires estimation and projection based on previous election results, opinion polling, political trends, recent developments since the previous election, and any strengths or weaknesses of the particular candidate involved. The swing-state \"map\" transforms between each election cycle, depending on the candidates and their policies, sometimes dramatically and sometimes subtly."

The project report Zhongguo Xueqian Jiaoyu Fazhan Zhanlue Yanjiu Ketizu 2010 reflects upon the development of China's early childhood education and locates the current situation of the development of early childhood education. The historical development of Chinese early childhood education indicates three distinct cultural threads, including traditional culture, communist culture, and Western culture, that have shaped early childhood education in China, as demonstrated in Zhu and Zhang 2008 and Lau 2012. Furthermore, currently, administrative authorities intend to establish an independent budget for the ECE field in order to support early childhood education in rural areas (Zhao and Hu 2008). A higher quality of educational provisions for children living in rural areas will be another goal for the Chinese government. Many researchers have detailed the important issues of early childhood education, especially teacher education. The exploratory study in Hu and Szente 2010 (cited under Early Childhood Inclusive Education) has indicated that Chinese kindergarten teachers hold negative attitudes toward inclusion of children with disabilities, as they do"

Only pollen-collecting bees are attracted to their flowers due to a lack of nectar rewards in the blooms of P. ambiguus.\n\n Cultivation \nBecause of the showy nature of its upwards facing blossoms and long-lived nature, many gardeners regard bush penstemons as one of the best penstemons to grow in gardens.In hot, dry environments with well draining soil bush penstemon are recommended, but are difficult to grow in other conditions. In areas warmer than -4 °C (USDA hardiness zone 9 and above) the plants will largely stay green and may bloom all winter. Plants grow larger and more robustly in sandy soils and substantially smaller in heavier soils. In colder areas, bush penstemons often die back nearly to ground level, but they are hardy to about -23 °C to -17 °C (USDA hardiness zone 6). Unlike the seeds of many colder climate penstemons, the bush penstemon has seeds that do not exhibit any significant decrease in germination when directly planted at 21 °C"

One of those is the \"relative calling\" or laqb that is always used in Arabic literature. \"Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal Abu 'Abd Allah al-Shaybani\", for instance, is prevalently called \"Ibn Hanbal\" instead of \"Ibn Muhammad\". Or, \"Muhammad bin Idris ash-Shafi`i\" is always called \"Imam Al-Shafi'i\" instead of \"Imam Idris\" or \"Imam Muhammad\". This is how the Arabs refer to famous persons in their daily life.

These compounds are thought to have been synthesized with the intention of making a synthetic cannabinoid prodrug, which might improve absorption and confound detection. Ester bonds are easily biodegradable through spontaneous or endogenous, nonspecific esterase hydrolysis, which has been commonly used in medicinal chemistry to make ester prodrugs. The reason for the change to the quinolone substructure is unknown, but it may have been found to be a suitable replacement for the naphthoyl moiety that is currently regulated by US scheduling laws.Although most synthetic cannabinoids are not direct analogs of THC, they share many common features with THC.

In this optimization framework, Deep Blue has the power to \"steer a chessboard's future into a subspace of possibility which it labels as 'winning', despite attempts by Garry Kasparov to steer the future elsewhere.\" Hutter and Legg, after surveying the literature, define intelligence as \"an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments\". While cognitive ability is sometimes measured as a one-dimensional parameter, it could also be represented as a \"hypersurface in a multidimensional space\" to compare systems that are good at different intellectual tasks.

Paramount wants to have their own cinematic universe for Transformers, similar to Marvel's/Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe (which had been one of Paramount's previous film series), and DC Comics/Warner Bros.'

Goldsman is the head of the future projects, and worked with franchise director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura to organize a \"writers' room\" that incubates ideas for potential Transformers films. The writers' room members include Christina Hodson, Lindsey Beer, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari (Ant-Man), Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead), Art Marcum & Matt Holloway, Zak Penn (Pacific Rim Uprising), Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2), Ken Nolan, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.

Søren Kierkegaard describes Abraham's actions as arising from the zenith of faith leading to a \"teleological suspension of the ethical\".\n\n Muslim views \n\nThe version in the Quran differs from that in Genesis in two aspects: the identity of the sacrificed son and the son's reaction towards the requested sacrifice. In Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. The son mentioned here is traditionally understood to be Ishmael. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing him. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised"

He was deeply interested in the works of Jean-Hippolyte Michon (1806–1881), who is considered to be the founder of modern graphology (science of handwriting analysis). For much of his career Crépieux-Jamin analyzed and revised Michon's work, which included reclassification and re-grouping the system of \"handwriting signs\", and developing new rules on their classification.\nIn his 1929 book ABC de la graphologie he laid out a classification system of seven categories in which 175 graphological signs are grouped. The seven categories he used are titled: Dimension, Form, Pressure, Speed, Direction, Layout and Continuity. As an example the category \"Form\" would contain various graphological signs such as: \"rounded\", \"ornate\", \"harmonious\", \"confused\", et al.\nCrepieux-Jamin took a \"holistic approach\" to handwriting analysis,"

Such reasoning could further explain what has happened with Zerubbabel and Shealtiel.A key difficulty with these explanations, however, is that there is no adoption in Jewish law, which of course is the relevant legal tradition even according to Jesus (Matt. 23:1–3), not the Roman legal tradition.

Peak wind speeds were estimated at 130 mph (210 km/h). The supercell cycled again and produced an EF1 tornado northeast of Fountain.The last tornado from this storm resulted in another EF2 tornado touching down southeast of Marianna. The tornado struck an RV park at EF2 intensity, where seven injuries occurred. The tornado continued northeast and struck a brick home, unroofing most of the residence and collapsing half of its walls. Peak wind speeds were estimated at 125 mph (201 km/h). The longest-tracked and widest tornado of the outbreak touched down southwest of Graceville. It snapped and uprooted trees and damaged a manufactured home. The tornado then crossed into Alabama where it produced a long stretch of snapped or uprooted trees. The tornado moved northeast and struck Cottonwood, Alabama, where it unroofed one home. A CMU church building was completely leveled. It continued northeast where it then crossed September Road, destroying a manufactured home at high-end EF2 intensity, killing the lone occupant.

The local, he says, described Cuprom's mining equipment under Ceaușescu to be \"rudimentary\", incapable of fully extracting the most fine-grained gold or copper from its ore. Since Cuprom was built on a swamp, this local said, the only way to maintain structural integrity while building out the complex over the years had been to use this under-extracted backfill to fill in the marshland. This, Boldor claims, is why the dirt around the Cuprom complex contains millions of dollars of unprocessed gold and copper.\nIn 2012, Baia Mare's mayor declared hundreds of Roma shanties just outside the city unfit for habitation and forced the families to relocate into an abandoned block of offices in the Cuprom complex. For decades, Roma had made a living selling scrap metal from the same facilities. Boldor believed the only way to pull these Roma out of poverty was to show them what a successful Roma looked like.

When choosing models, it is common to use a portion of the available data for fitting, and use the rest of the data for testing the model, as was done in the above examples.\n\n Cross-validation \nCross-validation is a more sophisticated version of training a test set.\nFor cross-sectional data, one approach to cross-validation works as follows:\n\nSelect observation i for the test set, and use the remaining observations in the training set.
