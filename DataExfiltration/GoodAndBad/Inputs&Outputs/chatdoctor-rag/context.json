  "input: Hi, im around 19 years old and was diagnosed with a brain tumor not even a yr ago. And they dont know whether it is cancerous or not. But I have major headaches everyday.  But Ive had about 2 MRIs and the tumor has grown. But recently everytim I stand up I get very dizzy and everything will go black for about 20-30 seconds and my head will ache really bad! Should I be concerned at all? Is it normal for this to happen? And everyone tells me im getting up too fast but sometimes it will do it when im just walking and most of the time I dont get up fast at all!\noutput: Hello, thanks for using Chat Doctor Persistent headache are likely due to the increase pressure inside your cranium due to the growing tumor. Symptoms associated to growing intracranial mass generally worsens as the mass increases in size causing compression of brain structures. You need to meet a neurosurgeon for better evaluation and investigation. For definitive treatment of the mass related headache, surgery will be needed, and it will be best at an early stage. Hope this helps you. Best regards\n\ninput: I have a recurrent pituitary tumor.

  "input: My friend was just diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis . He is 52 years old and has always been a heavy drinker. He is not wanting to talk about this to anyone because he told me he isn t going to be around long . I have heard people can be treated and live with this disease, but he thinks it s an automatic death sentence. Can you tell me more of what to maybe expect for his future?\noutput: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I assume that the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis is made on biopsy. Autoimmune hepatitis is a progressive disease, but there are medications which antagonize the antibodies produced by the body. When medical treatment is not effective liver transplant is being done in good number of centers all over the world. So, consult a hepatologist and discuss the further management for the problem. Console your friend that there is no need to be disheartened. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. \n\ninput: my 11 yr old daughter been diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis and has been turned down for DLA could you giv me your opinion as i think she should be entitled as shes not at school very often and has weekly hospital visits and is struggling gettin around\noutput: Hi.thanks for posting query at ChatDoctorinsufficient history provided - NO lab results, anyhow, autoimmune hepatitis is usually treated with steroids and in case of elevated liver enzymes - a special diet is advised. Value of AST or ALT greater than 85 or above maybe investigated further. Alcohol ingestion and obesity are common causes of fatty liver disease. Advice :- rule out viral causes of hepatitis-LOW fat diet should be followed, AVOID junk food and beverages-decreased oil consumption (oily food)- NO red meat-green vegetables should be ingested daily-use lemon juice (lemonade) once in a day-reduce weight if overweight/obese-pure olive oil maybe used in less amount-\"recheck liver enzymes after 6 to 8 weeks\" and/or ultrasound. Any further questions are welcomed. Hope to answer your concern. Wish your daughter good health. Regards, Chat Doctor. ",
  "input: Hi I have been using propygenta for the last year and a half for mole like allergies on various locations. some of the allergies have disappeared but some of them are still there. the dermatologist i visited told me that i have vascular dermititis and that i am allergic to chocolate, peanuts, strawberry, chips, frostings,etc. and that i should never eat them. Ihave discontinued eating those things and i have regularly used propygenta cream but i can see no development in my condition. Please advice me on what i should do.\noutput: Hi, thank you for providing the brief description of your history. As mentioned in your history about the determination of your consciousness I am really amazed. Well to understand further, you have been trying all things, and now you feel there are no improvements. Why don't you try performing breathing exercises, meditation and general exercises. As the combination of three has an effect on the metabolic system and immune system. What you need now is to reactivate the metabolic system and immune system. By which there will be a good Chat Doctor.  Also, after the symptomatic medication the body needs its own medical help, than can be possible by reactivation of the immune and metabolic systems. I wish you a good health.

You will end up limiting yourself with social groups and forming relationships and also need a way of paying for them. They are illegal for a reason.... and I have been down the horrible path of them and still battle with cravings and indulging in ones that appear more legal like sleeping pills or diet pills... not just the illicit recreational kind but they're all addictive and what goes up must come down.",
  "input: My husband has 35+ stents, has advanced coronary heart disease. A few days ago he had severe pain, went to the ER and his doctor did a cath. It seems his right coronary has taken a dump, and now a collateral artery has taken over the work. How long can someone in this situation live, productively.\noutput: With the break history, I could make out that he is 35 yrs of age and has undergone angioplasty with stent. Also that he had chest pain recently and repeat coronary angiogram is done. It would be better for me to give proper advice only after seeing his reports. I could only tell that once a Coronary Angioplasty is done with good job, the person can live quite long - if he is following good Lifestyle, and taking all prescribed medications on time - there is no reduction in life expectation after angioplasty - yea to support this statement I would like to know his Heart condition (Heart Function - EF)\n\ninput: I had a stress test on a treadmill that was borderline for ischemia.

  "input: My dad was recently diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia. The doctor initially said the blockage wasn t bad enough for treatment & he would just watch it. Now, several months later, the blockage is worse but the doctor says the sugery is not an option, that my dad would not survive it & that it s worse than heart surgery. He offered no other treatment options. My dad is now having pain everytime he eats & has extreme bloating in his abdomen (not sure if this is from the ischemia or a lung issue that he has right now).

I also recently developed head pain in the temple or head not lasting though as in headaches.. and feel not well.. I also have lightheadness , and something that actually happened about a couple of months after the fall,,, and had very bad spells, which prompeted to seek a chiropractor who helped me in the immediate, abut it seem as though it is back..  any feedback.. is the jawbone deteriorating with the periodontal disease and that one tooth affected by it..? any other suggestions and or comments?\noutput: HelloWelcome to ChatDoctorDont worry about alveolar loss or bone loss.

I plan to see my girlfriend this weekend and was wondering about how to approach having sex safely for myself.  Thanks\noutput: Hi, I value your concern regarding the symptoms. I have gone through your symptoms, and in my opinion there is nothing to worry about, the concern in such cases is that too much bending movement can cause loosening of your metal implant, as far as you're approaching your girlfriend goes, do not try to be too experimental, and take it easy.

  "input: hi my name is kyra , i have been told that i am bipolor but i disagree !! anyway i was woundering if you could help me understand how to stop my mind from giving into my fear and keeping me thinking of harmful things such as my grandfathers death i was sleeping in bed with him when i woke up he was dead this was ten years ago but i still can remeber it all ,when i dont want to\noutput: Hello Rayon say that you disagree with your diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It can possible because many time a person is notbproperly interviewed ad wrongly diagnosed but for that you have to meet a psychiatrist again and get yourself interviewed in detail - there is no other way. The part of the remembrance of your grandpa s death needs both meds and therapy sessions. Only with the combination you will have good results and will be able to move ahead in life properly.

I firmly believe that he may be suffering from a form of bipolar but when i try and approach him about his behaviour he gets angry and thinks that it is all in my head and there is nothing wrong with him. His mood swings are becoming more frequent and it is starting to affect our 8 year old daughter, he needs help but i can t get through to him as he thinks there is nothing wrong with him. What can i do?\noutput: Your situation is very difficult, and I am deeply disturbed and sorry to hear about your suffering. It's all the more painful because you are not the one with the problem, it's your husband. My first piece of advice to you is to protect yourself and your child from this men outbursts. If you can, you should take your child and leave the house each time these outbursts occur. Notifying family members (and perhaps friends) of the situation will help to protect and support you to some extent. Your husband may indeed have bipolar disorder as you suspect, but more importantly he has a horrible lack of insight into his problem thereby making it impossible for him to understand his need for treatment. Because of this, his prognosis for improvement is very poor indeed. You cannot force him into treatment if he refuses it; however, a nicely written lawyers' letter on your behalf may help you. You may have to leave this man if he does not seek treatment for this intense problem. Best wishes and I hope things improve for you!",
  "input: Hi, I am afraid my boyfriend suffers from multiple personalities, or he might be faking it. We have been together nearly two years, and I have witnessed basically two different people when I am with him. He even has named the other person . The two people are complete opposites. One is loving and cares; while the other is rude and disrespectful. We have been fighting a great deal over this subject, and when I bring up some of the things one person said or did, the other person seems to be utterly clueless. I don t know how much more i can take before I loose my cool. The change can take only a few seconds but last hours to even days. Then suddenly, the switch back happens. I am confused on what I can do to help him, or if he is just faking it and using it as an excuse for when he is rude. Please help.\noutput: Oh, you are in such a helpless situation. There is nothing like multiple personality disorder. But yes there are many stories or movies regarding the same. From your narration I can say there are two possibilities. One is called dissociative order in which there are dissociative trans, dissociative fugue which contains the symptoms you described of change in personality. Second possibility is he is doing this on his own with full awareness. Both situation difficult to diagnose in one seating. I should tell you that you must take him to psychiatrist for consultation and detail evaluation. If really he has some problem, it can be treated and if he is faking, there should be some reason behind that also about which you need to deal sympathetically without anger to know the truth in detail.\n\ninput: About 2 years ago I noticed I became quite sad , my mood deteriorated quickly, i was harming myself many times a day and writing suicide notes, things got out of hand and eventually my parents found out (We didn t talk much about it). Soon after things got okay for a little while then went back down again, August this year I got a job and I couldn t of been happier. Its been a month and now I feel worse than ever, I m constantly thinking negatively. I m so wrapped up in what everyone thinks. This job is with children and they re all so great, I wouldn t want this to get in the way. I m a very private person and I can t bring myself to talk to a doctor face to face ( I have tried, it didn t go well and I ended up telling the counsellor I was refereed to that everything was fine), I just want to understand what is happening with out having to go see a doctor :/ can you help me please!!\noutput: Degree understand your concerns went through your description. I suggest you not to worry too much. Behavior of people change according to their circumstances and most of the people come out of that situation with the help of other circumstances. Life experiences, advices from elders and support from family members also help. To happen so, the victim should try wholeheartedly. Try and try and try. Thinking about what negatively happened in the past is foolishness. Carrying it with them even more foolishness. We need to learn positive lessons from the past event and forget the event itself. We need to pledge our self that we will come out and lead a successful life. You need psychotherapy and other cognitive behavioral therapies. I can help you through telephone. Please do contact me through customer care of www.ChatDoctor .com for a telephonic consultation session. Hope this clears some of your doubts. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.",

He has been able to control it through taking medications and not walking far, etc.  However over the past month he has suffered a couple of attacks during night.

Going by you description it looks like he has got unstable angina or critical coronary artery disease. Also since he is on maximum medications for the same.

If he was my patient I would keep hi non medical management and would adjust his doses/increase doses if necessary. Wishing him good health thank you.",

  "input: This is an embarrassing, but true and serious question: I recently dried to perform auto-fellacio, and basically spent an extended period of time trying to fit my head in between my legs. Needless to say, my back is killing me today from being so violently forceful yesterday. It feels like theres bruising right on the spine, and I have a bit of tingling in between my shoulder blades.

I have noted the details of your mother. It is unfortunate that she suffered a major stroke at a relatively young age. The cause of stroke is related to heart disease. The PT/INR is maintained by using adequate dose of warfarin or citron tablets. If the dose is less, the blood becomes thick, leading to ischemic stroke (lack of blood flow to the brain). The likely outcome and improvement depends on the exact location and size of stroke. So, if you can send the MRI or CT scan of brain report, it would be helpful in predicting the chances of recovery. In the meanwhile, the supportive treatment, physiotherapy, etc. should be continued. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/",

From what you have mentioned, you seem to be suffering from anxiety disorder. It seems that you are having repetitive thoughts regarding the same, and you understand such thoughts are irrational. Such thoughts can be termed as obsessions and the repeated cleaning or washing in response to the thoughts can be termed compulsions. Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder which is not uncommon. I would have liked to know about any other thoughts that might be coming repeatedly to you like any doubts (and repeated checking in response to that), repeated sexual or religious thoughts. I would suggest you seek a psychiatric consultation for detailed evaluation of your symptoms and starting proper treatment. Your condition can be treated effectively with medications like fluoxetine or sertraline (one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). You will have to be patient about the response as the medicines will take at least 10-15 days to show its effect. The treatment will be long term, and you will need regular follow-ups. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.",

  "input: Hi, I believe I may have panic disorder. I was recently diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on medication to help with it. A few weeks ago, I had my first panic attack. I was hyperventilating, trembling, sweating, and felt like I was going crazy and detached. I have had multiple attacks in the past month, often in my bathroom and at my mother s work office.

Is there ANYTHING i can do that doesnt involve medications, to ease any of these problems?\noutput: Hello and thanks for writing in. I understand that you are concerned about your problems of poor attention, disorganization and anxiety symptoms. From the description of your symptoms, it appears that you are suffering from an anxiety disorder, probably a generalized anxiety disorder. Your symptoms are not typical of an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD. Difficulties with attention, concentration and organization are commonly seen in anxiety disorders. If you would like to try non-pharmacological treatments, then you can try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, etc. You can also try self-help (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) CBT books or online CBT. If your symptoms are very distressing, then you may need antianxiety medication.",

I will be glad to be of assistance. I can understand your cancer. But It's important to first understand why are you getting this pigmentation and since how long do you have it. Whether it's an internal condition that needs to be controlled in order to treat the pigmentation or not.  I would recommend that either you send a picture if possible or request your doctor to run a few basic blood tests for you for thyroid etc. meanwhile you can use the glycolic acid 12% cream at night daily on the affected areas. Also using a sunscreen on the exposed parts will be helpful. If there is no internal cause detected, then even TCA peels will be effective which your dermatologist can do for you. Regards. Please let me know your queries.\n\ninput: Hi my name is JoAnne and i have a history with melanoma of the brain n spinal cord. I was diagnosed when I was 25.

She has had bad appetite for at least five years now, we can barely get her to eat anything.When she finaly manages rising her weight to normal, it takes her about a month or so to fall 7 kilo down, before getting back onto a proper weight track - which takes alot longer then a mere month for her.She was checked for asthma, and doesnt have it.Shes anemic for as long as I can remmeber, and her curent doctor doesnt give us any other information other then the words I dont know whats wrong with her.This causes me alot of consirn, as I am home with her daily.She doesnt have bulimia or anorexia because I would see if she was throwing up, or pushing food away.So far, shes forcing herself to eat, to gain weight, but still claims her chest pain is her biggest problem.The doctor also said he couldnt hear a heart murmur, so its not likely a heart problem - or thats as much as I understood.\noutput: Hello there, Two reasons come in my mind for her1- Cardiac problem though murmur not heard2- Anemia as for her in this age is common.",

I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. My PCP has been prescribing Percocet for me for 1 year. I take 2 - 3 per day...the dose is 5-325 mg. He no longer wants to give me the pain pills and wants me to see a pain doctor which I did. They told me their policy was not to treat fibromyalgia patients with narcotics. They prescribed Lyrica which I am willing to try. I don t want to stay on narcotics forever but this is the only think that has helped. Long story short, my co-pay for Lyrica is $1,156 every 3 months which I cannot afford. I don t know what to do. I am in pain every day and can t continue to work when I m in pain. I can t afford to go on disability either. Please advise what you think I should do.\noutput: Hi, as to let you know too much of painkiller is not good for human body and the organs as well. Why don't you try exercise which will be simple and helpful. I hope you have understood about this fibromyalgia. As it is a condition with the fibers of the muscle, you have a majority of the pain in the muscle fibers. Try doing regular exercises like free exercises, stretching, strengthening, endurance training, etc. This are some exercise option I personally try out for my patients who have fibromyalgia. Apparently till now it has helped them. I do try to implement for some meditation and breathing exercises. The only focus I try on my exercise prescription is to delay the fatigue. As fatigue can lead to pain I focus on improving their endurance and other weaker muscles. I hope you will get helped too like many others I have seen till date. I wish you a good health and a speedy recovery too. Thank you",
  "input: Hi I have had UTI on and off now for 15 years. I use to treat it with anti biotics. But now I just drink cranberry juice. It comes back severly when I have sex. The other day I had a horrible backache with high fever chills and felt like throwing up. I took advil to ease the pain now my tailbone hurts and ofcourse still have the symptoms of UTI.

As for the heart beating faster it can be due to anxiety or even in case of acidity if it is relieved after food. Please get examined by a doctor and get treatedThanks\n\ninput: I have recurring UTIs and recently was bed-ridden with extreme dizziness and vomiting for a day and a half.

  "input: Adult (32) white female; normal weight; normal BP (last time I was checked); semi-active (swim when I can get to the gym):How do you know when its time to see a vascular surgeon over a concern that you may have an abdominal aortic aneurysm?  My (paternal) grandmother had a cerebral (word choice?) aneurysm in her mid-forties and there is a history of heart disease on that side (my father, my fathers father, etc).  A (second?; maternal) cousin had an aortic aneurysm (not sure where).  I have no pain, just a transient pulsating feeling in my upper abdomen (epigastric-to-umbilical region - moreso epigastric, though) from time to time (e.g., primarily during times of mild stress or after eating).   I have recently had one or two episodes of numbness in my right leg lately but Im not sure if that has more to do with the fact that I do a lot of sitting (at work, commute to and from work, etc).  Ive noticed an increase in heart flutters - for example, sometimes when I wake up in the morning but before I get out of bed.  Not sure if thats related.  Could be related to caffeine.  Ive gotten them as far back as I can remember.When swimming, there are times where I feel like I have heart flutters as well.  It makes me uncomfortable enough to take a break. Typically while doing breast stroke (as apposed to freestyle for some reason).  Im not even sure why Im so concerned.  I guess maybe it is because I had a recent episode of nausea brought on by the feeling that I might pass out.  I am NOT pregnant. In fact, I thought it might somehow be related to constipation.  Turns out I was not constipated either.  It was a peculiar feeling and not the first time Ive experienced it.  Seemingly, it came out of nowhere - as opposed to something I might have eaten.  I dont know.  I figured Id give this a shot. Thanks for you time.\noutput: You seem to be concerned because of aneurysm in your relatives. And that is working on your mind and apprehension may be giving you varied symptoms. Just be relaxed as aneurysms are not heretical a\n\ninput: I am a 40 yr old female and I have an aneurism in my brain. It is in a very difficult location and the doctors cannot operate. It stresses me out knowing I have this. The doctors have been monitoring it for the last year and it has not changed in size. It needs to be bigger in order to clip it since it is on a necessary artery - they did balloon testing to check. How do I feel less stressed about this?\noutput: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Another way with similar results, that avoids surgery complications, is aneurysm coiling by means of occlusion or filling the aneurysm from inside the artery with very thin titanium wires, and this is done in specialized Neurosurgical center. (Digital subtraction arteriography). Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.",

I have had 2 CT scans and multiple scopes of neck. All have come back with no result/or answer to explain this pain. My neurologist just had a stellate nerve block performed with little result(did feel a little relief), last week and thinks that i should have another one performed ASAP. stating that the effect is greater the more you have(limit 4)? I guess my question is that i am unable to get over the fear that they are missing something in the CT? is this a possibility? Should i inquire about having an MRI? is there any difference?FYI..I also smoke marijuana before bed--lightly\noutput: Hello, You have been very thorough and utilized specialist which would be my first recommendation. I would continue with the treatment recommended by the neurologist that offered relief and hope for benefit with the cumulative effect with multiple treatments. The MRI is utilized in evaluating soft tissue and is a very valuable diagnostic test. Contrast medium can show details on vascular components which may assist your diagnosis. You may have an autoimmune component or have a multiple condition syn Chat Doctor.  I suggest checking on your family history and look for any genetic disorders that could help with diagnosing. You may consider anti-inflammatory medications and muscle relaxers for temporary relief. Ask your doctor for suitable prescriptions. Thank you for your inquiry.

You haven't mentioned if you are taking any form of treatment. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is amenable to treatment. You should consult a psychiatrist for the same. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine, sertraline is safe and effective. In addition to medications, you can also opt for cognitive behavior therapy if someone trained in it is available in your area. It will consist of frequent sessions with your therapist and behavioral measures for obsessions and compulsions will be taught. Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.\n\ninput: I think I might have OCD, but I am not sure. I was reading about it because I was worried about a friend, but then I read that tapping or counting numbers was a sign of it. For a while now, I have been repeating words in my mind, and each syllable gets a finger. Then I tap on my fingers what I just heard. I can t skip over fingers, and it has to end on a pinky or thumb. Am I OCD?\noutput: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor .OCD comprise obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions: Repetitive, Intrusive,illogical, unwanted thoughts, ideas or images comes in to mind though person doesn't want them, and they create some discomfort. Compulsion: Obsessions make the person to do something repeatedly related to component of the obsession and if person doesn't do the same, he/she feels so much anxiety, discomfort and distress. If these obsessions and compulsions are so frequent that they cause problem in persons daily routine, work and wasting of time, we can say person has obsessive compulsive disorder. If your repeating word and tapping fingers are obsession and compulsion as I describe above, and they create difficulty in your work, you should consult a psychiatrist for detail evaluation. If your habit is for a while and not repeated, and you are not feeling not discomfort, just relax and forget about your concern of having OCD, then you are normal. Hope I have answered your query,",
  "input: A parent just shared that her almost-adult son has displayed voluntary encopresis.  There are sometimes remains left in the bathtub.  This young man has also begun stealing from people and he describes that it is like an addiction, where he wakes up thinking about stealing.  His parents are divorced, he lives with Dad and Step-mother who constantly criticizes him.  He was an outstanding baseball player, but began stealing from teammates.  He is defiant at home, his grades are falling, hes lost interest in the things he used to do, such as baseball.  The adults dont forgive him and theyve stripped him of a phone, a bedroom door, etc. and have given him no way to earn things back.  This young man says hes not suicidal; hes using pot.  This is such a mental disorder and I dont want to do more harm to him as a school counselor.  What type of therapy do you suggest?  How do I get the parents to understand this behavior is very much about them?\noutput: HiT hanks for using Chat Doctor I think, he has conduct disorder or cannabis induced psychosis and in that case, he needs proper mental evaluation by psychiatrist. If he has conduct disorder, then he needs behavioral therapy. Being a counselor, you can try positive and negative reinforcement in his case. That would help to modify his behavior. In case of psychosis, he would improve with antipsychotic Chat Doctor.  Better to tell them to consult a psychiatrist. In case, you need further help, you can ask.

It is a matter of pleasure that your wife has survived cancer after removed of cancerous thyroid followed by radiation. Regarding her medication, I want to know  Why Synthroid is prescribed, after14 years of recovery ?. Did any problem occurred?  I suggest you, pls keep your treating doctor aware of side effects if any. And keep going for regular check-ups. By getting rid of the microbes in the organs, plus doing the normal cancer treatments, the balance (i.e. a strong immune system and a low number of cancer cells) is restored enough to keep the cancer from coming back. The patient is cured because their immune system has been regulated through well planned regimen. Because proper nutrition is an integral part of a healthy immune system, the kitchen is the perfect place to find natural home remedies to bolster your disease-fighting abilities. Regular intake of high fiber diet includinfruit veges, whole grains oats, antioxidants- vitamins, and minerals as ginger, garlic onion, preferable in raw form, nuts - almonds, walnut .flex seed, Avoid fried, fast foods' bakery products, tea coffee, alcohol Lemon juice with water twice before meals, Bitter gourd 25 ml in the morning coconut water a great antioxidant Turmeric powder 1/2 spoon in a cup of hot milk.

Noe exercise is so limited due to fibro pain. I am now seeing a new urologist who said the bladder problems lie more in not being able to void fully. I don t know I am just so tormented and completely exhausted. Wondering if it could be more of a kidney issue? I feel and feverish many days. Sometimes my body gets hot....

A surgeon must examine for any prostatic problem as you can't evacuate fully, incomplete voiding may be due to benign enlargement of prostate and should rule out. Your urologist may have to give a thorough work up to find cause for staring definitive treatment. You may avoid, spices, excess beverages and take plenty of plain water, also avoid sugary Chat Doctor.

My knees and shoulders are also starting to be painful.Im due at the Drs next week, do you think i should as about ankylosing spondylitis?\noutput: Thank you for the question. Good that you now seek help from an orthopedist. You may leave it to him to decide after X-rays and MRI of the spine for the origin of pain and management accordingly. Ankylosing spondylitis is just one of many conditions which give trouble and certainly a not very frequent cause. It gives much more stiffness in spine at various levels.

He is 52 and gives himself a shot daily.  Doctor says it is for me to decide if I should take medication or shots???  What to do??\noutput: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. MS is a treatable disease, and there are excellent medications available to prevent relapses. In my opinion, interferons are the best. You can either take once a week intro muscular Avonex or thrice a week subcutaneous Rebid. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. \n\ninput: I have had M.S. for almost 30 years.  After this long, family just seems to ignore it.  Sometimes I want to scream it out, but that would seem too in your face.  I dont want them to feel sorry for me, I just want them to understand that it just doesnt go away.\noutput: I read your question carefully however you don't say anything about your disease course which can be different from one patient to the other. You don't say anything about your medication either. Generally speaking MS is managed by treatment for relapses with short courses of steroids and disease modifying therapy which traditionally has meant interferons or Latimer acetate, while now there are many newer options like fingolimod, omalizumab etc. As for the family understanding there is no medicine for that, you could try to talk about it with them, take them with you when you go for check-ups, so they can hear what your doctors have to say and realize what you go through. I hope to have been of help.",

My Hepatologist has retired and now I am looking for another one. My question from you is this, based on this brief information I have given, what would you recommend? Thank you kindly,\noutput: Hi, you are a hepatitis B positive since 2 years, and you are not using any medicine with your doctors advise or individual reasoning. I am asking because the virus is a virulent and wait for an opportunity to attack the patient.  During any convalescence it may flare. I prefer to give to my patients the supportive therapy to the liver, so that the patient may not be at risk.  If it is your hepatologists opinion he will be the better judge.  Thank you.",
  "input: My 61 year old husband was diagnosed with hypetrophic cardiomyopathy a few years ago. He has been seeing a Cardiologist ever since and a pacemaker/difibrilator was placed to reduce his risk of sudden death. In March his legs started swelling and he was very short of breath and was taken to the ER where he was diagnosed with CHF. He was hospitalized for one day while the fluid was removed and was sent home with strict diet instructions. He s on several medicines to which they ve now added a low dose diuretic. He s done very well sticking with the low sodium diet, exercising, and following all of the lifestyle chances. He has maintained his weight and feels better than he has in a year or more. I m very confused as to his prognosis. When I asked his cardiologist about a prognosis I was told that he has the good kind of heart failure and that the main issue to worry about is sudden death which is why the device was implanted, but when I talk to our family doctor he doesn t seem to think he ll live very long. The ER cardiologist mentioned that he didn t think the ChatDoctor was being managed well enough and changed several dosages of his medicines. He also mentioned that there are two surgeries that are options if his condition worsens. One is an alcohol ablation and the other is septal myectomy. My question is two-fold: Realistically does he fall into the dreaded 50% chance of dying in 5 years, or since the heart failure seems to be caused by the ChatDoctor can either of these two surgeries turn the heart failure around? What is the good kind of heart failure? I ve never heard of such a thing. I m younger than he is and we have a young child together the stress of constantly worrying about his life expectancy is overwhelming.\noutput: Hi, Lets start from the surgery. Your doctor may have explained to you that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle gets very thickened. Such thickened muscle may produce life-threatening arrhythmias, that's why defibrillator was implanted, which is the most efficient way\n\ninput: My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. I did some research, and discovered that he has nearly all of the symptoms of heart block and many of the symptoms of heart failure. Whenever he has an episode with his heart, he gets very dizzy, nauseous, has chest pain and cold sweats, and eventually has a blackout. Is there anything that I can do to alleviate his symptoms when they occur?\noutput: Hello, thanks for reaching out to us. I understand your worry towards your boyfriends' health. For treatment of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White, it depends on lots of factors like presence of other diseases that might be present, the degree of severity etc. The best advice I have for you is to encourage him to see his cardiologist to know the best treatment possible in his case. I hope he gets better soon. Warm regards",

These days always keep quite during a discussion and cannot think on my own and when I try to say something it sounds boring and its does not make any sense. I often stop in the middle of conversation and forget to speak important points.Very difficult time to finish easy tasks and make decisions.

Your response is highly awaited and thank you in advance for replying.\noutput: DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your descriptions. I sincerely doubt your diagnosis that you have some memory problems. There are so many memory losing diseases and associated ones. You don't fit into any of them. Memory loss means not remembering to eat food, not able to recall what you ate for breakfast (sincerely), etc. The incidents you point out do happen to busy people and that is why keep a schedule of events and a calendar of appointments. Orators keep notes and refer them when they speak. Most people take a list while shopping trip. You don't have to worry about these silly happenings. Keep your brain active and work hard. Always say you have good memory. You will feel better. Don't lament yourself. Hope this answers your doubt. Available for further queries. Good luck.",
  "input: Well I have been diagnosed as probable ALS by seven different doctors. It has been an on again off again diagnosis. I have definite CSm but this has been known for over 20 years now. My symptoms leading to ALS have started the past 3 yrs.. Recently a neurosurgeon has said that additional surgery would not help. Help please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\noutput: Hi, Thank you for using Chat Doctor. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neuromuscular disease that weakens and eventually destroys motor neurons (components of the nervous system that connect the brain with the skeletal muscles). Treatment is only palliative and there is no cure for ALS. Supportive treatment is given to relieve pain and improve the quality of life. Treatment is based on individual therapy and continuous adaptation of medications. Suggested treatment for ALS include :1. Rissole (Dilute) : it is one of the Chat Doctor.  2. Baclofen (Lionel) or tizanidine (Zanaflex) may be given to relieve spasticity.3.

He went to a specialist last week and he thought it to be a pinched nerve due to the disk in his neck . He sent him for an MRI and called back a few days later saying that the MRI showed a suspicious spot and they wanted to do another test at the hospital next week. My husband said the nurse said something about sonogram/ultrasound on the phone. He has been researching on the Internet and has convinced himself that it may be ALS and now I m worried as well! Do you think it could be this? Thanks for your time!\noutput: Hello and thanks for the query ALS is a motor neuron disease and usually diagnosed by clinical symptoms. On other investigations is a definite test for diagnosis. MRI scan came back normal in patient with ALS. The problem you are facing is most likely to be PIED of the cervical spine as your doctor has in his mind. Weakness, numbness and tingling are present in this disease. So don't worry and go through the investigation and then get to a decision. There might be some technical problem that result in repeat scan. Best Wishes",
  "input: Good day,I suffer from a real problem. I looked it up on the Internet and found the scientific name of it is social phobia.When there is a group of people with me it becomes very very very hard for me to talk. I become confused and started sweating and i lost every thing in mind. is there a solution to my problem :(\noutput: Hi, I read your query and can understand your distress. From what you have mentioned, it is likely that you might be suffering from social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety is a situation where you avoid social situations, feel that you are always being scrutinized by others and worry that you might embarrass yourself publicly. It would be advisable that you consult a psychiatrist for your problems. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are effective for your condition. In addition, treatment with behavior therapy sessions will help you in controlling your anxiety. You will need regular sessions (1-2) per week with trained therapist for the same.

He doesn t want to talk to anyone. He is fearful of going outside, other people. He cannot go anywhere and doesn t know why. It is driving him crazy and myself. He s been to the ER several times, once baker acted and spent time in a recovery center that just drugged him and made him worse. First his PCP felt he was severely depressed and tried prestiq but it didn t do anything good. He bacame more depressed and isolated. At one time he refused to eat and drink and lost 40 lbs. He s been to the PCP, psychiatrist, and ER several times since October. Nobody knows what this is and nothing has helped.\noutput: Hello, Social anxiety disorder is a chronic mental health condition in which social interactions cause irrational anxiety. For people with social anxiety disorder, everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, self-consciousness and embarrassment. Symptoms may include excessive fear of situations in which one may be judged, worry about embarrassment or humiliation or concern about offending someone. Talk therapy or psychotherapy and antidepressants can help increase confidence and improve ability to interact with others. I suggest online psychotherapy and counseling.

Suggestions would be great as he is giving up on life at this point.\noutput: Welcome to Chat Doctor, From my extensive experience in long term care I have found that getting patients to eat is a problem or providing assistance when needed is even a bigger problem. You can help by getting the family together and try to have someone there at mealtimes to encourage feeding. Check to see if he is still on blood sugar medicine or if it has been decreased or discontinued with respect to his blood sugar. If it hasn't been adjusted, make them adjust it. Contact the State and file a complaint if you observe them sitting the tray in front of him with no assist or if you find his medication has not been adjusted to his blood sugar, or you find pressure sores worsening. Discuss tube feeding or in between meal supplements per family/pts wishes. Your loved one deserves quality of care, and it is the law in the US. Document everything. Please feel free to contact me should you need any other help with your father-in-law or in dealing with the facility. Also, by law in the US, reports on quality of life and care should be hanging by the facility door or in another public place where you have access to it. Review it to see if they were cited for similar lacks of care in the previous survey. So sorry for your situation.  Kathryn J.

I am now starting to feel an on and off sort of throbbing mild crampish kind of pain in my right front side. I am a woman. Question: am I supposed to wait for pain to arrive at any time soon? Could it pass without more pain? It seems too LARGE to do this without pain. HOW could I help pass it quickly before it maybe grows and becomes harder to pass? Tired of drinking water. Anything I can take naturally without medicine or do I need medicine? I prefer alternative or holistic or homeopathic remedies. I also recently discovered -incidentally through an MRi from a minor car accident, 1 .9 cm benign fluid-only cyst on each kidney. Are cysts and kidney stones related?

I just started taking a sugar controller herbal tea yesterday. I generally eat healthy my whole life and am shocked by all of this? Age maybe? No excuse. Not everyone has these things. I love life , a loooong life and want to get rid of the sugar problem, the stones and the systs and high choleterol NOW before anything happens.

You have been detected to have stones of a size of 5 mm in both the kidneys. Assuming that you do not have severe pain I would say that these are",

Doctor has advice me to go thruogh a chest x-ray, it shows little congestion in lungs. But doctor has told me that it cant be the cause of chest pain. I am an field executive and had to work through the entire day in the field. I used to take alzolam 0.5mg every night because I have severe sleeping disorder and tremendous pressure of work. May I please know how can I get relief of the pain?\noutput: Hello, Once fully recovered from ARDS, there should not be severe chest pain interfering with the daily activities. On the reverse, minor congestion will also be not responsible for the intense pain. I recommend deep breathing exercises, inhalation therapy and assisted chest physiotherapy at present for primary relief till your expert guides you further. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
