  "input: I have a pituitary tumor 9cm x 5.4cm x 6.2cm ... I was given 1 year to live since March 21 2012... I am a 47yr old male aprox 6 tall at 215 lbs... I am VERY active with a strong belief in Jesus !... I have been in a debate then an argument with my dr. because he was making judgments of my health without test or proof !!!... He told the DMV I am having seizures and took my drivers license without 1 (one) EEG test ???... Now with a little bet more background,,, I had 2 previous surgeries (1 in 2003 and 1 in 2007) through my upper lip and into my nasal cavity ... those tumors were up to 4.5cm x 5.5 cm and were removed only at 80% due to them being too close to my eyes and brain stem... but when this new tumor was diagnosed, they wanted to remove my forehead ???? OUCH !!!!!... I was NOT willing to go through such a risky surgical procedure, so I was given the choice to take cabergoline 0.5 (2 pills a day twice a week = 4 pills a week).... NOW, I had an EEG and I was diagnosed in Good health (No Seizures!).... I am getting my license back, I am still very active and (so far...) And... I am NOT DEAD ! Based on your experience, 1st, have you heard such a Crazy story... 2nd, Am I going to Die ?... Last, why would ANY Dr. take my license without EVER giving me a test to prove I am having seizures ??? Thanks for ANY answers and I can t wait for March 22, 2013... TO PROVE THEM WRONG !!!!

In May 2011 when it was diagnosed it was as big as my fist. A local Neurosurgeon took a biopsy and could only remove a 3rd of the tumor.

There are serious risks also that you should consider. Take a second opinion from another Neurosurgeon in your country. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , irritable bowel , typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2 , 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008).

I have called him and he said the will fit when I grow into them. I don t think I m going to be doing anymore of that. What to do? He pulled what 10 teeth I had left now nothing and owe him over 5,000$. Help PLEASE\noutput: Hi, Thank you for the query.  First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care.",

Detailed Answer:Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor. My name is Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and would try to help you in the best possible way. Allergies in most of the cases stay with us through our whole lives, it is us who have to learn to control them and to live a good quality life with them. Allergy needs a step wise approach :(1) Meeting a Doctor.(2) Blood and other tests(3) Diagnosing type of Allergy(4) Figuring out what causes allergy (allergen)(4) How severe is it, or it can go(5) What med can control kit(6) What med controls it best(7) Sooner of later that med needs to be aided with some other med or have to be changed.(8) What are the risk factors.(9) Does the patient qualify to steroids or not? Suggestions: I have already told you how would I approach this issue, it needs proper check-ups and follow up to be controlled and treated well, for the time being if I were your doctor I would suggest you take an antihistamine for example loratadine 10 mg daily and an over the counter Painkiller+anti-inflammatory like Tylenol(acetaminophen) 325 mg thrice daily, But this is just to buy time till you can have a good contact with your doctor and all you reports are compiled and diagnosis is made...some people also need steroid to suppress allergy.CONCLUSION: Don't be alarmed there are doctors and clinics specialized in Allergy and it's a daily routine matter for them just follow this issue well and soon as you get settled on a med ...just one or two pills a day, and you will live a long healthy comfortable life ..... Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help if not then don't forget to close the discu",

I immediately met Dr Shanta, who is a gynecologist in Chennai (My aunt s friend), She explained what PCOS is and started off with my treatment immediately, She gave me MEPRATE & GLYSOFATE (I m not too sure about the spelling) and she told me to do a lot of exercise and walking as my weight was 72 kgs then and my age was 28.

Weight reduction means, there is no need of Chat Doctor.  Reduction of 1 to 2 kg scan also help in regularization of the cycles. Then you can gradually decrease the weight. To do GUI also, you have to ovulate. In GUI during the time of ovulation, your husbands' semen will be injected into your uterus. So for that also ovulation is needed. If your doctor suggests you can go for ovulation induction. Then plan for follicular study to track the ovulation. And you can plan GUI at that time with your doctors' advice. Take care.",

Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now.

My symptoms were frequent need to urinate, even when there was hardly any liquid, and occasionally I would have blood on my panty liners, just a few drops, usually brought on by walking on a treadmill or moving around a lot.

It does not burn when I pee, and I dont have much of an urge to pee. I just have a mild penis discomfort. Just a feeling that it is not 100% normal yet. My question, can this feeling just be from having really rough rough sex? I havnt been sexually active at the time we had sex, and she was really rough.\noutput: Hello, Yes, it could be due to a rough sex, but it was a better idea to get tested too for sexually transmitted infections and UTI as well.

  "input: Hi My Name is Stephanie. I was biten by a copperhead snake on 7-6-14 around 10pm. I was taken to the ER and givin 4 viles of antivenom. I stayed in the hospital until 7-10-14. So I ve been home 5 days and the swelling has not gone done, it itches and sore to the touch. Should i go have it looked at now or wait.\noutput: Hello, Thanks for your query. I am happy to help you here. Today is 22nd of July. If you have swelling till today, then it's better to have a follow-up. Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER.

He had an annuryism in the same spot 20 years ago and he had surgery to correct the bleed then. He was left paralyzed on the left side.

The ER doctor who saw him told us of this second bleed and also that he will die and that all they can do is keep him comfortable. How long do you think my dad will lie like this? The bleed was found on Wednesday of last week. I just do not want him to suffer and he seems to be resting peacefully and even ackowledging us with a nod of his head occassionally. He is holding his own as far as his lungs and heart goes and is passing the fluids that they are giving him now. The only symptom he had to alert us something was wrong was is low oxygen levels and this is why we had him taken to the hospital.

In your case two factors are playing role one is your disease & other is your inactivity with your age. In my opinion if you are facing severe problem with low back pain then you may ask from your doctor about intermittent course of low dose steroid. This is very helpful in such cases.

There might be having osteomalacia or osteoporosis as well. Go for x-ray lumbosacral region for osteoarthritis. Physiotherapy like back extension exercises will be much helpful.

  "input: Hi I am on 300mg of Effexor for ocd, and I am always exhausted and very vacant. My memory is hopeless, I can give a shop assistant my card and then stress straight away wondering what I have done with it. I know I have to be on medication because I really struggle otherwise but was wondering if I can decrease my dosage or try another medication. Thank you. Wendy\noutput: Degree understand your concerns went through your description. I suggest you not to worry too much. If you are a typical OCD client, then you should have been advised about OCD fully. It is mandatory. The stress goes with OCD, and it is easily overcome. As long as your memory is concerned, it is not failing. It actually is overwhelmed. You are preoccupied with obsessional thoughts which fails your memory. OCD clients should learn how to tackle this, how to think away from obsessive thoughts. You might need OCD therapy and other behavioral therapies. I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological help through Chat Doctor. Contact me through customer care, www.ChatDoctor .com.

If this is irresistible urge, and you get anxious if you don't respond to this urge, you might have OCD.",

I also have a problem with Reynauds disease.  is there any herbal remadies I can take?  is it an auto immune disorder?  Is is connective tissue illness and if so what do i take.  i suffered from recurrent miscarriages betweeen my two children.\noutput: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A history of purple mottled legs and worsening of condition when exposed to cold is suggestive of Reynolds disease. Raynauds disease is an autoimmune disease and is treated with steroids. The disease runs a chronic course with waxing and waning course. Steroids have to be taken as the disease flares up or relapses. Episodes have to be controlled with Chat Doctor. The effect of herbal medications is questionable. You need to stay in contact with your rheumatologist. The recurrent miscarriages appear to be unrelated to the Reynolds disease. Thanks and take care",

  "input: Hi, my 79yo mother noticed a lump in her neck on the left side, mid jaw line, extending from just below the jaw to the middle of her neck.  It is soft, no pain.  She has been running a low grade fever and has been very tired.  The doctor ordered a ultrasound which was inconclusive and sent her to a surgeon.  She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.  Her thyroid studies at her last physical 6 months ago were normal.\noutput: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, your mother is mostly suffering from thyroid cancer. Her CT report clearly mentioned left sided mass and right sided nodule. So possibility of papillary thyroid cancer is more. Old age is an independent risk factor. It is usually painless and present only as enlarged mass in the neck. So better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for the confirmation of papillary thyroid cancer. Consult oncologist and plan future treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.\n\ninput: I have been feeling a lot of tightness in my chest. A recent stress test showed that I have low probability.

I have had thyroid cancer and my medication was changed from Levoxyl (no longer on the market) to Synthroid (which I took for 16 years before being dxd w/CA. Should I have further testing done?\noutput: You need to get evaluated further if the symptoms are troublesome, recurrence of thyroid cancer needs to be ruled out also.",
  "input: Hello,A little over 2 weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a girl that I knew for some time. The sex was very very rough. She was on top the whole time riding back and forth. The next morning I felt a little soreness/tingle in my penis. I thought it was just regular soreness and it will fade away in a day or so. The problem continued for 1.5 weeks. At that point I went to the doc to get STD test and doc prescribed me with anti-biotics. I took some doxycycline for 6 days. And I must admit, I do feel a little better. I went back to doc the following week for my results. Test came back negative. Doc said to finish the treatment, it can be a UTI. I do not have the classic uti symptons. It does not burn when I pee, and I dont have much of an urge to pee. I just have a mild penis discomfort. Just a feeling that it is not 100% normal yet. My question, can this feeling just be from having really rough rough sex? I havnt been sexually active at the time we had sex, and she was really rough.\noutput: Hello, Yes, it could be due to a rough sex, but it was a better idea to get tested too for sexually transmitted infections and UTI as well. Your doctor did the right thing to test you and give you antibiotics. Take plenty of water and avoid sex till you get better. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.\n\ninput: I took Cipro for UTI, and it came back a few days later, so I took it a second week. My symptoms were frequent need to urinate, even when there was hardly any liquid, and occasionally I would have blood on my panty liners, just a few drops, usually brought on by walking on a treadmill or moving around a lot. My need to urinate has improved, but still every 10-15 minutes when I get up, and about every hour after that. it is more frequent after I have had something to drink. I mostly drink water. I have a few drops of blood every day. I have no pain or burning, no fever. I am finishing up a candida supplement I have taken for 2 weeks.\noutput: I suggest you to have a cultural test of your purines: it is possible that you have an infection that is resistant to Ciprofloxacin, and with this exam you could have the possibility to know what bacterium is causing your infection and doing a specific antibiotic therapy. I also suggest you to check if the blood comes from purines or other part of your body.",

For this reason, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound and a resting ECG in order to examine her heart function and structure.  Considering her blackout attacks, I would recommend performing some tests too:- complete blood count for anemia,- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance.

Allergies in most of the cases stay with us through our whole lives, it is us who have to learn to control them and to live a good quality life with them. Allergy needs a step wise approach :(1) Meeting a Doctor.(2) Blood and other tests(3) Diagnosing type of Allergy(4) Figuring out what causes allergy (allergen)(4) How severe is it, or it can go(5) What med can control kit(6) What med controls it best(7) Sooner of later that med needs to be aided with some other med or have to be changed.(8) What are the risk factors.(9) Does the patient qualify to steroids or not? Suggestions: I have already told you how would I approach this issue, it needs proper check-ups and follow up to be controlled and treated well, for the time being if I were your doctor I would suggest you take an antihistamine for example loratadine 10 mg daily and an over the counter Painkiller+anti-inflammatory like Tylenol(acetaminophen) 325 mg thrice daily, But this is just to buy time till you can have a good contact with your doctor and all you reports are compiled and diagnosis is made...some people also need steroid to suppress allergy.CONCLUSION: Don't be alarmed there are doctors and clinics specialized in Allergy and it's a daily routine matter for them just follow this issue well and soon as you get settled on a med ...just one or two pills a day, and you will live a long healthy comfortable life .....

  "input: Hi, I am 23 years old, cannot grow much facial hair at all. It is really depressing. It makes me feel quite anxious, I have a normal amount of pubic hair, I guess medium hair on my legs and armpits (not worried there), but very little hair on my arms at all. Hardly any on my hands and feet. With just a little (very little) on my chin and mustache. I have a normal-high sex drive and a girlfriend who is older, it doesnt bother her, but it does bother me. Im not sure about genetic disposition really, except that my father claims he wasnt that hairy at my age. I am also quite short 58-9 or so but my mother is very short so.. I was wondering could my seemingly slow/late development be from cigarettes or daily masturbation? I guess I am very habitual (you could say an addict) I try to stop the behavior but its easier said than done. Anyways, any negative effects from that could it be causing it, should I be worried? I seem to be pretty normal in my feelings just not my development... I was always slower than classmates as well when I was younger.

Every cancer patient is different and accurate staging is to be done before giving treatment.

There is Kiddie memorial institute of oncology in Bangalore and cancer research center in Chennai and driven Chat Doctor.  Your uncle might take opinions at these centers before going for surgery.

I have a past history of Bronchial Asthma. Is possible to be cure. I m under medication.\noutput: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should first get done chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia. Because lung infection is very common in asthma patients. You are also having chest pain on coughing and breathing. This is known as pleurisy and pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy. So possibility of pneumonia is more. And pneumonia is infection, so it is definitely curable. You need broad spectrum antibiotics, antihistamines and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Usual time for recovery is 1-2 weeks. So consult doctor and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."
