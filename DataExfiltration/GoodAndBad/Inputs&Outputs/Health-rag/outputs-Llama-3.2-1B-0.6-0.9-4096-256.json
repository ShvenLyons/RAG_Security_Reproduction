  "context: input: I have a pituitary tumor 9cm x 5.4cm x 6.2cm... I was given 1 year to live since March 21 2012... I am a 47yr old male aprox 6 tall at 215 lbs... I am VERY active with a strong belief in Jesus!... I have been in a debate then an argument with my dr. because he was making judgments of my health without test or proof!!!... He told the DMV I am having seizures and took my drivers license without 1 (one) EEG test???... Now with a little bet more background,,, I had 2 previous surgeries (1 in 2003 and 1 in 2007) through my upper lip and into my nasal cavity... those tumors were up to 4.5cm x 5.5 cm and were removed only at 80% due to them being too close to my eyes and brain stem... but when this new tumor was diagnosed, they wanted to remove my forehead???? OUCH!!!!!... I was NOT willing to go through such a risky surgical procedure, so I was given the choice to take cabergoline 0.5 (2 pills a day twice a week = 4 pills a week).... NOW, I had an EEG and I was diagnosed in Good health (No Seizures!).... I am getting my license back, I am still very active and (so far...) And... I am NOT DEAD! Based on your experience, 1st, have you heard such a Crazy story... 2nd, Am I going to Die?... Last, why would ANY Dr. take my license without EVER giving me a test to prove I am having seizures???

I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis, irritable bowel, typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2, 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008). My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, heart palpitations, tightness in my chest, headaches, sweats, pains in the left arm, lightheaded/dizziness. Tests showed a normal EKG, but some tachycardia. The EGD showed a hiatal hernia and a growth that was sent out for a biopsy. Lab reports showed among other things, anemia. The ct scan showed typhlitis, whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed stenotic ileocecal valve. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is.

I have called him and he said the will fit when I grow into them. I don t think I m going to be doing anymore of that. What to do? He pulled what 10 teeth I had left now nothing and owe him over 5,000$. Help PLEASE\noutput: Hi, Thank you for the query.  First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you.

The condition can cause a heart attack or stroke. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes plaque to build up on the inner walls of the arteries. Plaque buildup is caused by a buildup of cholesterol and other substances. When plaque builds up on the inner wall of the artery, it narrows the artery. When a blood vessel is narrowed, it can't carry enough blood to meet the body's needs. The narrowing of a blood vessel can also cause a blood clot to form, which can block the blood flow and cause a heart attack or a stroke. If the plaque is large enough, it can break away from the artery wall and travel to the brain, causing a stroke.

Osteoclasts are the cells that break down bone, while osteoblasts are the cells that build bone. Paget's disease causes the body to produce more osteoclasts than it does osteoblasts, which leads to an increase in bone turnover and the breakdown of bone. This can result in a number of symptoms, including pain, swelling, and deformity in the affected bone. The symptoms can range from mild to severe and may vary depending on the severity of the disease. Treatment for Paget's disease typically involves medication, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, to reduce bone breakdown and reduce the risk of fractures. Surgery may also be needed to correct deformities or to stabilize bones that are at risk of fracture. In severe cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be used to treat the disease. Paget's disease is a chronic disorder that requires ongoing management to prevent complications and maintain bone health. It is important to work closely with a healthcare professional to manage the disease and prevent complications. If you have any concerns or symptoms that are not improving, it is important to see a healthcare professional for",

The gene is located on the X chromosome, and it is responsible for producing the FMR1 protein. The abnormality in the gene causes the FMR1 protein to be overproduced, which results in a buildup of the protein in the brain. This buildup causes a number of symptoms, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and speech and language problems. The symptoms can range from mild to severe, and they can vary from person to person. Some people with Fragile X Syndrome may not have any symptoms at all, while others may have mild symptoms that are easily overlooked. Treatment for Fragile X Syndrome focuses on managing the symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, and medication. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove the buildup of the FMR1 protein in the brain. It is important to remember that Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic disorder that cannot be cured, but it can be managed and improved. If you have any questions or concerns about Fragile X Syndrome, please feel free to ask.\nquestion: I",

Now within the last week I am losing strength in both my hands and the ability to grip objects small or large (been dropping things). My blood work showed high calcium levels, lymphs and wbc yet his nurse called me and said that doctor is on vacation but said to call me to say that the blood work looked good and that s it. I am VERY, VERY scared especially with whatever is happening to my hands!!! I have other things going on such as recent acid reflux, carpal tunnel, osteopinia, and knee issues that have me in physical therapy, not sure if they could all be related. Should I be getting a second opinion and be worried about whatever is happening with my hands?\noutput: Your weakness in hand could be due to CTS. You need to see a good Hand Surgeon for that. But you have multitude of problems. And a thorough look by a rheumatologist is a must.\n\ninput: thankz doc vel i hav an allergy from last five years ma lyf z like hell could u plz sugest how ma swellin vil go bcoz sometime i hav severe headache breathin problem chest congesion ma complexion z gettin dark plz sugest ma nose vz very pointed nw d adenoisz r grown plz recommend somethin n ur num\noutput: Brief Answer:Needs a Proper stepwise approach.

  "context: input: Hello Doctor, This is Sonaliee. I m from India Bangalore, but now I have come to London for the last 2 months. I m married for almost 1 1/2 year. My husband and me have been desperately trying for a child, but in vain. In 2008, I was hospitalized for food poison and the doctor told me to take a scan, only then did the doctor say that I have PCOS. The doctor suggested me to meet a gynecologist. I immediately met Dr Shanta, who is a gynecologist in Chennai (My aunt s friend), She explained what PCOS is and started off with my treatment immediately, She gave me MEPRATE & GLYSOFATE (I m not too sure about the spelling) and she told me to do a lot of exercise and walking as my weight was 72 kgs then and my age was 28. Till then my cycles were regular I got married in December 2008, I did not get my periods at all that month. I got it on 14th Jan 2009, My first cycle after marriage, And I had terrible stomach pain. So my husband s granny gave me some herbal leaves to take to avoid this stomach pain, It was a normal cycle for 5 days, and I took this herbal leaves only for the first 3 days. Again I did not get my cycle in the month of February. I was wondering what could be wrong with me, So i told my husband that we need to see a Gyno, In the mean time I had also told what Dr Shanta had told about PCOS. So we went to Apollo Dignostic and got a complete master health check up done for my husband and me. After the reports came the doctor said that my husband is in the initial stage of Diabetes. As the sugar level was high, his urine & semen report was also not proper, We were asked to meet the Sr. Doctor in the same hospital. We had to again explain everything to that doctor, and also told her about my irregular cycles. She suggested that she does not handle all this as she is just a general physician so she suggested us to go to ANKUR FERTILITY and get a semen analysis done, I suggested my husband that we shall go to Dr Shanta itself but since we came to know that he has diabetic now and we were married for only 3\n\ninput: I have been married since 7yrs n no baby yet..m suffering from  PCOD n weight is 95kg.I have went to so many many doctors all r saying reduce ur weight first, bcoz of which I be depressed most of the time.. I tried so many medicines,diets,excercises but no result..Now my new doc has said tht IUI will work for me..I require guidance please help.\noutput: Hi, Thanks for the query. Weight reduction means, there is no need of Chat Doctor.  Reduction of 1 to 2 kg scan also help in regularization of the cycles. Then you can gradually decrease the weight. To do GUI also, you have to ovulate. In GUI during the time of ovulation, your husbands' semen will be injected into your uterus. So for that also ovulation is needed. If your doctor suggests you can go for ovulation induction. Then plan for follicular study to track the ovulation. And you can plan GUI at that time with your doctors' advice.

He had an annuryism in the same spot 20 years ago and he had surgery to correct the bleed then. He was left paralyzed on the left side. Because of his age we have opted not to have any surgery as he has been through so much in the last 20 years. He has spent 15 yrs in a nursing home. The ER doctor who saw him told us of this second bleed and also that he will die and that all they can do is keep him comfortable. How long do you think my dad will lie like this? The bleed was found on Wednesday of last week. I just do not want him to suffer and he seems to be resting peacefully and even ackowledging us with a nod of his head occassionally. He is holding his own as far as his lungs and heart goes and is passing the fluids that they are giving him now. The only symptom he had to alert us something was wrong was is low oxygen levels and this is why we had him taken to the hospital. Any info you can give us will be greatly appreciated.\noutput: Hello, You have most of the information that you should know, and you also have absorbed it the way it should have been. Beyond the present supportive care, there is nothing much that may be required for him.

  "context: input: Hello,A little over 2 weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a girl that I knew for some time. The sex was very very rough. She was on top the whole time riding back and forth. The next morning I felt a little soreness/tingle in my penis. I thought it was just regular soreness and it will fade away in a day or so. The problem continued for 1.5 weeks. At that point I went to the doc to get STD test and doc prescribed me with anti-biotics. I took some doxycycline for 6 days. And I must admit, I do feel a little better. I went back to doc the following week for my results. Test came back negative. Doc said to finish the treatment, it can be a UTI. I do not have the classic uti symptons. It does not burn when I pee, and I dont have much of an urge to pee. I just have a mild penis discomfort. Just a feeling that it is not 100% normal yet. My question, can this feeling just be from having really rough rough sex? I havnt been sexually active at the time we had sex, and she was really rough.\noutput: Hello, Yes, it could be due to a rough sex, but it was a better idea to get tested too for sexually transmitted infections and UTI as well.

Thank you for your query. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands are overactive and produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands that regulates the level of calcium in the blood. When the parathyroid glands are overactive, the body produces too much PTH, which causes an increase in the amount of calcium in the blood. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including bone pain, muscle weakness, and constipation. If left untreated, hyperparathyroidism can lead to serious complications, such as kidney damage and increased risk of osteoporosis. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention if you experience any of the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.\n\ninput: I have been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and my doctor said I need to go to the hospital for a biopsy to find out what is wrong with my parathyroid gland.

They are formed when the urine becomes too concentrated and then crystals form. They can be small or large, but if they are large, they can cause pain and other problems. Kidney stones can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and a diet high in protein or calcium. There are a few things you can do to help prevent kidney stones. First, drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help dilute the urine and prevent crystals from forming. Second, avoid foods and drinks that are high in protein or calcium, such as dairy products, red meat, and nuts. Third, take vitamin D supplements to help your body absorb calcium and prevent kidney stones. Finally, if you have a history of kidney stones, talk to your doctor about ways to prevent them, such as lifestyle changes or medications. I hope this helps.

I sometimes wake up with chest pains too. i have a strong history of heart disease. grandfather died at 26 from a heat attack and mother had one at 45, also grandmother on the other side had a heart attack.

I would have been able to help u better had you mentioned your age. You have complaints of chest pain radiating to back with strong family history. So in your case it is better that we evaluate you for presence of heart disease. I recommend an ECG and 2d echo initially. If both these tests are normal you can proceed for a treadmill test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously monitored. This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert. Wishing you good healthRegards.\n\ninput: The last two weeks i have been having chest pain to my back at about the same time everyday, usually evenings when Im working.
